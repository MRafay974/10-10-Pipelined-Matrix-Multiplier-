# 10-10-Pipelined-Matrix-Multiplier-
This project is written in Verilog and python. Python script to transfer data and receiver receives the data and pass the data to matrix multiplier module which multiply the data and then forwards the data to transmitter module which sends data back to python script (vs code terminal).This project is synthesizable on spartan 6 FPGA.
